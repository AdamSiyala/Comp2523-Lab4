So I did terrible!
This is another file that trys to explain what I am trying to implement and my poor attempt at implementing it. 

Now in my index.ejs file, I tried to dynamically code a way to show all movies. I added a for each loop because I believe it was the easiest way to get a certain amount of movies to list.

in app.js, i used 3 posts. the first one was for myform. I tried to split up the string we recieved by using .split . I then tried storing it in a variable. After that, I wanted to render the page.

searchResult was difficult (all of this was.) But I believe that I could use my string as a way to search? so i can say that IF the ovie i am looking for is in my movie list, I will add it to the list.

query string needed a req.query. I stored the information in movieList and tried to send my data to the server
